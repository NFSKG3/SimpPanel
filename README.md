# SimpPanel
A alternitive Control Panel GUI
This project can be useful when you need to accsess control panel options without remembering the .cpl names.
Need to fix a sound problem? You're in luck.
Want to change the mouse cursor... just because? Well you can do that too.

---What's the point?---
Domains can remove Control Panel listings  in the Windows CP GUI. You can still accsess these settings, but however you have to remember ridiculous names.
For example, main.cpl takes you to Mouse settings. 
This offers a point-and-click GUI for opening these .cpl files.

Note: SimpPanel 2018.1 has been removed for confedinciality of my last name being contained inside.


NEW: Windows 10 is supposedly phasing out the Control Panel. I have no idea if the Control Panel is being completely removed, or just the interface is, but I'll either archive this repo or continue supporting this program depending on how this goes.
